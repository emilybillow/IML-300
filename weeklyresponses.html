<h1> <font size="4">Week 1: 8/22/18 <br> Diagrams / Arakawa: The Mechanisms of Meaning </font> <br>
<font size="3">The relationship between diagrams and meaning is either very evident or very obscure. Many diagrams directly relate information or facts, therefore the relationship is that they present meaning to a viewer. Other diagrams, however, may not be as obvious in what they are showing. These kinds of diagrams rely on additional outside information to relay their meaning, or they leave it to the viewer to take meaning away. Perhaps these diagrams are meant to have a different meaning unique to each person who sees it. An example of this obscure kind of diagram is Arakawa’s Diagram with Duchamp’s Glass as a Minor Detail. It is clear that Arakawa and Duchamp both created diagrammatic art that was not concrete in meaning. Wether or not the artist’s themselves had an idea of what it meant to them does not mean viewers take away that same idea.
	I think the difference between diagrams for art and non-art would mainly be in the way information is presented. More informational and discernibly clear diagrams are used for traditionally non-artistic purposes, such as education, medical uses, or other process-demanding areas. Diagrams for art take more liberty with their formats, mediums, and boundaries. As Arakawa practiced and preached with his own art, “the aim is to creatively test the limits of thought and logic”. This can clearly be seen as his work crossed diverse mediums, subjects, and even related to other fields of work. I really enjoyed the way Arakawa said that you must become a scientist before an artist. I think he added a much deeper meaning and thought process being his artistic decisions by using that scientific background and working with the concepts of physics and philosophy. Knowing this makes his work much more interesting to me.
	The relationship between diagrams, maps, and networks is that they are all ways to present information. Diagrams and maps are visual tools, though a network might not be. Either way, they are ingrained in our society and humans constantly rely on them.</font>
